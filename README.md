# XwordJS

XwordJS is a crossword puzzle web app with puz file support, written in React.

You can use it to play most crossword puzzles in a browser locally without a
server, or you can optionally build it with support for xword-server[1] and
gain some additional features like syncing across devices.

## Building
To run the development server:
```
npm run start
```
To build for deployment:
```
npm run build
```
